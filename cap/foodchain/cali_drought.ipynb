    "\n",
    "# Explore the impact the 2011-2017 drought had on California food supply, in volume and food prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Over all question to solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Did food production decrease during years of drought in California? \n",
    " - In the most agrarian counties? \n",
    " - Focusing on key crops from the county?\n",
    "- Did food prices of key foods increase?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reach: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Were increases in price seen for these crops during or shortly after these periods of drought?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context: \n",
    "\n",
    "- A large amount of food grown and eaten in the US comes from areas with low average rainfall. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The last decade saw some of the most severe droughts in recorded history. What impact did this have on agriculture?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much food in the US is grown in California? In arid climates? What defines arid?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminary questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the most 'important' crops in California by volume?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the most 'important' counties in California for amount of agrarian land and volume of produce?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How is a drought defined? How is its severity measured?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What factors impact food availability beyond crop yields?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What factors impact price of these crops?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Far Reach questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What alternative water sources were used and how effective were they?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What counties did better during drought times, posibility due to different topography, different crops, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- droughts in california, by county, during target years\n",
    "\n",
    "- food production by county of target crops\n",
    "\n",
    "- prices of target crops!"
